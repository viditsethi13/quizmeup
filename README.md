<h2> Architecture </h2>
  <p> This Django project follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern. The components are organized as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Model:</b> The models defined in the project represent the data structure and handle interactions with the database. They are implemented as Python classes that      inherit from the django.db.models.Model base class.</li>
    <li><b>View:</b> Views handle request processing, business logic, and data retrieval. They receive HTTP requests and return HTTP responses. Views interact with models    to fetch or manipulate data and pass it to templates for rendering.</li>
    <li><b>Template:</b> Templates define the presentation layer of the application. They are HTML files with embedded Django template language (DTL) tags and filters. Templates receive data from views and render it to produce the final output.</li>
  </ul>
  This separation of concerns allows for a clear and modular development approach, making it easier to manage the different aspects of the application and promote code reusability.<br>
